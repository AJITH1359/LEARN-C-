    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the "Learn C and C++" repository! This repository documents my journey of learning C and C++, from the basics to more advanced concepts. I aim to improve my programming skills, explore low-level programming, and develop efficient and performant code.</p>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Clone the repository to your local machine:</li>
    </ol>
    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/your-username/Learn-C-and-Cpp.git</code></pre>

    <ol>
        <li>Set up a development environment with a C and C++ compiler.</li>
        <li>Start exploring the <code>C/</code> and <code>Cpp/</code> directories to find the code examples for each day of learning.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Daily Progress</h2>
    <h3>Day 1 - [Date]</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Learned about variables, data types, and basic I/O in C.</li>
        <li>Wrote a "Hello, World!" program in C.</li>
        <li>Explored the fundamentals of C++ and its differences from C.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Day 2 - [Date]</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Covered control structures like if-else and loops in C.</li>
        <li>Implemented a program to find the factorial of a number in C.</li>
        <li>Learned about object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in C++.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Continue adding daily progress for each learning day -->
