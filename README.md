## About The Project

![Screen Shot](image/candc++.png)

Welcome to the "Learn C and C++" repository! This repository documents my journey of learning C and C++, from the basics to more advanced concepts. I aim to improve my programming skills, explore low-level programming, and develop efficient and performant code.

Throughout this learning journey, I plan to cover a wide range of topics, including data structures, algorithms, memory management, file handling, and more. By diving deep into C and C++, I hope to gain a solid understanding of how these languages work and how they can be leveraged to build powerful and robust applications.

In addition to exploring the core concepts, I will be working on exciting projects that put theory into practice. These projects will not only reinforce my learning but also serve as valuable portfolio pieces to showcase my coding skills to potential employers and the developer community.

I am open to collaboration and feedback from the community. If you come across any errors in my code or have suggestions to improve the learning material, please don't hesitate to reach out. Let's learn together and make this repository a valuable resource for aspiring C and C++ programmers!

Join me on this adventure as I delve into the world of C and C++. Together, we will unravel the mysteries of these powerful languages and unlock the true potential of our programming abilities. Happy coding!

## Built With

Pure C and C++

## Getting Started

For C: Install a C compiler such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).
For C++: Install a C++ compiler such as g++ (GNU C++ Compiler) or Visual C++ (for Windows).

### Prerequisites

Before you dive into learning C and C++, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

A code editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Code::Blocks.
Git: Version control system to clone and manage the repository.
A working knowledge of basic programming concepts would be beneficial, but not mandatory.

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up your development environment and run the code examples:

<b>Install a C and C++ Compiler: </b>Refer to the official documentation for your operating system to install the appropriate compiler.

GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) is commonly used for C and C++ on various platforms.
Code Editor or IDE: Install a code editor or IDE of your choice. Choose one that best suits your preferences and operating system.


<b>Clone the Repository:</b> Use the git clone command mentioned in the "Getting Started" section to clone the repository to your local machine.

<b>Explore the Examples:</b> Navigate to the C/ and Cpp/ directories to find the code examples for each day of learning. Open the files in your code editor or IDE to explore and run the code.

Let's embark on this learning journey together and discover the exciting world of C and C++. Happy coding!

<code>
In this example, the "Getting Started" section provides instructions on how to clone the repository and set up a development environment. The "Prerequisites" section outlines the requirements to follow the code examples, while the "Installation" section explains the steps to install a C and C++ compiler and set up your code editor or IDE. These sections will help users understand how to get started with your repository and start learning C and C++.
</code>

## Usage

<p>To run the code examples and projects in this repository, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Navigate to the specific directory containing the code you want to run, such as `C/` or `Cpp/`.</li>
        <li>Open the desired code file in your preferred code editor or IDE.</li>
        <li>Compile the C or C++ code using your installed compiler. For example, if you have GCC installed, use the following commands in the terminal or command prompt:</li>
    </ol>
    <pre><code>gcc -o output_file_name source_file_name.c</code></pre>
    <pre><code>g++ -o output_file_name source_file_name.cpp</code></pre>
    <p>Replace `output_file_name` with a desired name for the output file and `source_file_name.c` or `source_file_name.cpp` with the name of the code file you want to compile.</p>
    <p>After successful compilation, you can run the executable by executing the following command:</p>
    <pre><code>./output_file_name</code></pre>
    <p>For Windows users, the command to run the executable may differ.</p>

    <p>Feel free to modify and experiment with the code examples to deepen your understanding of C and C++. Have fun learning!</p>
